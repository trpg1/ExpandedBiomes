# ExpandedBiomes
Adds new biomes and resources to minecraft

This repository is mostly for the issue tracker. If you wish to see the source code of the mod visit the CurseForge page (https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/expanded-biomes). I have added .zip files you can import into MCreator to view to source code to every version.
